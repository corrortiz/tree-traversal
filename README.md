# Tree Traversal App

## Comments Problem 1
I decide to use a simple function instead of a class, for me is more simple to implement is this way as I believe there is more familiarity with the syntax making it a little more simple to reed and understand 

I notice that the `sampleTree1` doesn't have null branch's and the `sampleTreeArray2` does have the nulls, in the sample 1 the nulls are part of the binary tree but for sample 2 is different, when something like this happen in the day to day I will look for clarity of the bushiness rules and try to no assume how it has to function
