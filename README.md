# Tree Traversal

## Problem 1

Implement a function in JavaScript or TypeScript that takes an array as input with format: [id, leftChild, rightChild], and parse this array into a binary tree data structure, with the tree node interface as follows and return parsed data as JSON.

```javascript
interfaceBinTreeNode { id: string | number, left: BinTreeNode, right: BinTreeNode  } 
```
